# Quantitative Finance Functions

This is a collection of code that I use regularly in my Quant Fin tasks and projects

The `Metrics class` in `quant_funcs.py` includes functions that calculate simple, but necessary statistics for stocks

The `TimeSeriesDecomposition class` in `quant_funcs.py` provides a framework for the use of some esoteric decomposition techniques on stock data

I will be adding a lot more functionality in the coming weeks. I might even add some Jupyter Notebooks with some content on differing systematic strategies
